This is just a simple web app with a vlcj backend to stream ISOs locally to your browser.

There are a couple of glaring bugs in this right now:
- You canot see the selected menu item
- Menus sometimes won't repeat and the stream will end if they don't
- VLC web plugin sometimes hangs

I'm putting this on the backburner for now as I just recieved a Raspberry Pi to play with!
